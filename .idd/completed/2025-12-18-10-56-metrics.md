# MISSION METRICS: 2025-12-18-10-56

## CHANGE SUMMARY
feat: add TUI-based status command with mission history

- Created internal/mission/reader.go to parse current and completed mission files
- Added search and load functionality for missions from .idd/completed/ directory
- Created internal/tui/status.go with bubbletea TUI components and lipgloss styling
- Implemented status display showing current mission state with color-coded indicators
- Added completed missions list with keyboard navigation (Tab to switch views, ↑/↓ to navigate)
- Added next steps guidance based on mission status (active/completed/failed)
- Updated cmd/status.go to use interactive TUI instead of simple text output
- Added comprehensive unit tests for mission parsing functionality
- Included comprehensive keyboard shortcuts and help text

## MISSION DATA
- **Type**: WET
- **Track**: 3 (Robust - TUI development with cross-cutting UX impact)
- **Duration**: ~38 minutes (10:18 - 10:56)
- **Files Created**: 4
- **Files Modified**: 1
- **Verification**: Passed

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS
- Used bubbletea for TUI framework (already available in dependencies)
- Used lipgloss for styling and color-coded status indicators
- Implemented mission parsing with proper error handling
- Added comprehensive unit tests with temporary file testing
- Designed keyboard navigation for intuitive user experience

## COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
- **Planned Track**: 3 (Robust)
- **Actual Complexity**: Matched - TUI development with cross-cutting UX concerns
- **Files Planned**: 3
- **Files Actual**: 4 (added unit tests during execution)

## PATTERNS DETECTED
- Mission parsing logic could be abstracted for reuse
- TUI components follow consistent styling patterns
- File reading patterns consistent across mission operations

## DUPLICATION OPPORTUNITIES
- Mission file parsing patterns (for future DRY mission)
- TUI styling patterns (for future TUI components)
