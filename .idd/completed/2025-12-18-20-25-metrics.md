# MISSION METRICS

**Mission ID**: 2025-12-18-20-25
**Timestamp**: 2025-12-18 20:25:23
**Type**: WET
**Track**: 3
**Status**: completed

## TIMING
- **Completed At**: 2025-12-18T10:56:07.465-05:00
- **Duration**: ~38 minutes (from git commit message)

## SCOPE ANALYSIS
- **Files Planned**: 4
- **Files Modified**: 4
- **Scope Accuracy**: 100%
- **New Files Created**: 3 (tui/status.go, mission/reader.go, mission/reader_test.go)

## CHANGE SUMMARY
**Title**: Add TUI-based status command with search functionality and mission history

**Description**:
- Created mission parsing functionality with reader.go to handle current and completed missions
- Implemented interactive TUI using bubbletea framework with lipgloss styling
- Added search and filter capabilities for completed missions from .idd/completed/ directory
- Designed color-coded status indicators for mission states (active/completed/failed)
- Added keyboard navigation and comprehensive help text for mission browsing
- Updated status command from simple text output to full interactive TUI
- Included comprehensive unit tests for mission parsing functionality
- Added next steps guidance based on current mission status

## COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT
- **Planned Track**: 3 (Robust)
- **Actual Complexity**: 3 (Robust) - Multiple new components, TUI framework integration
- **Track Accuracy**: Correct
- **Domain Multipliers**: UI/UX complexity, external framework integration

## VERIFICATION
- **Command**: go run . status && echo "TUI status command executed successfully"
- **Status**: Passed (confirmed in RESULTS section)
- **Manual Testing**: Interactive TUI functionality verified

## PATTERNS DETECTED
- **TUI Components**: Reusable patterns for bubbletea/lipgloss integration
- **Mission Parsing**: Generic file parsing patterns that could be abstracted
- **Navigation Logic**: Keyboard handling patterns for future TUI components
- **Future DRY Candidates**: TUI styling, mission file parsing, keyboard navigation

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS
- Used bubbletea for TUI framework (industry standard for Go CLI apps)
- Implemented lipgloss for consistent styling and color coding
- Created separate mission/reader package for parsing logic separation
- Added comprehensive unit tests for parsing functionality
- Used Tab key for view switching, arrow keys for navigation
- Implemented search functionality within completed missions list

## FILES MODIFIED
- `cmd/status.go`: Updated to use TUI instead of simple print output
- `internal/tui/status.go`: Created full TUI implementation with bubbletea
- `internal/mission/reader.go`: Created mission parsing and search functionality  
- `internal/mission/reader_test.go`: Added comprehensive unit tests for parsing logic
