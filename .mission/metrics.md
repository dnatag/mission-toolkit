## PROCESS INSIGHTS
- Strong preference for Track 2 (Standard) missions indicates good scope planning
- 100% success rate shows effective mission planning and execution
- No DRY missions yet - pattern detection working as intended (WET-first approach)
- Average 5-minute execution time suggests appropriate atomic scope sizing
