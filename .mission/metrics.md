## RECENT COMPLETIONS
(Last 5 missions with change summaries - see `.mission/completed/` for full history)

- 2025-12-21 Track 2: feat: add happy path testing for m.apply and m.complete using AI-native framework
- 2025-12-21 Track 2: test: create AI-native M.CLARIFY test case with track reassessment validation

## PROCESS INSIGHTS
- Strong preference for Track 2 (Standard) missions indicates good scope planning
- 100% success rate shows effective mission planning and execution
- No DRY missions yet - pattern detection working as intended (WET-first approach)
- Average 5-minute execution time suggests appropriate atomic scope sizing
