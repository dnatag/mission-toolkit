# MISSION METRICS

**Mission ID**: 2025-12-21-13-15
**Type**: WET
**Track**: 2
**Status**: completed
**Duration**: ~3 minutes
**Files Modified**: 1

## CHANGE SUMMARY
test: create AI-native M.CLARIFY test case with track reassessment validation

- Created comprehensive AI-native test specification using Given/When/Then format → enables AI agents to validate M.CLARIFY prompt logic through structured natural language reasoning
- Defined realistic mock scenario with payment processing clarification workflow → demonstrates track reassessment from TBD to Track 3 based on revealed security and performance requirements
- Included detailed clarification responses triggering 4 domain multipliers → tests detection of high-risk-integration, performance-critical, regulatory-security, and complex-algorithms multipliers
- Added 8 reasoning-based assertions with expected trace validation → provides systematic validation methodology for AI agents to verify clarification processing and track escalation logic

## TECHNICAL DETAILS
- **Scope Adherence**: ✅ Created test case file as specified in SCOPE
- **Verification**: ✅ AI-native test format and structure verified
- **WET Approach**: ✅ Initial test case implementation without abstraction
- **Pattern Detection**: No duplication patterns identified

## PROCESS OBSERVATIONS
- Track 2 mission executed successfully for single test case creation
- AI-native test specification demonstrates clarification workflow complexity
- Natural language assertions enable AI reasoning-based validation
- Test case validates core clarification and track reassessment logic
