type: WET
track: 3
status: completed
duration: ~13 minutes
files_modified: 3
lines_changed: ~50

## COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
- Initial estimate: TRACK 3 (6-9 files)
- Actual scope: 8 files modified
- Complexity drivers: Multiple template files, search/replace logic

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
- Used search/replace instead of Go templating for simplicity
- Added prefix logic function with comprehensive tests
- Modified templates to include slash command references

## VERIFICATION RESULTS
- All tests passed
- Manual verification successful
- Prefix replacement working correctly for both @ and / prefixes

## LESSONS LEARNED
- Search/replace approach simpler for initial implementation
- Template modification approach allows easy testing
- Comprehensive test coverage important for prefix logic

## TECHNICAL DEBT
- Could refactor to use Go templating system in future DRY mission
- Consider adding more template validation
