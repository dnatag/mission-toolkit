id: 20251228123730-7892
type: WET
track: 2
iteration: 1
status: completed
completed_at: 2025-12-28T12:49:53.784-05:00

## INTENT
Fix chronological sorting issue in TUI status historical list where older missions appear out of order

## SCOPE
- internal/mission/reader.go
- internal/mission/reader_test.go

## PLAN
- [ ] Improve sorting logic to handle missions with nil CompletedAt values
- [ ] Use filename-based fallback sorting for missions without completion timestamps
- [ ] If filename parsing fails, place missions at the end of the list
- [ ] Add unit tests for sorting logic to prevent regression
- [ ] Ensure consistent chronological ordering with newest missions first
- [ ] Note: Allow duplication for initial implementation

## VERIFICATION
./bin/m status (verify chronological ordering in historical list)
