type: WET
track: 3
iteration: 1
status: completed
completed_at: 2025-12-20T22:47:16.367-05:00

## INTENT
Create comprehensive test fixtures for validating all prompt workflows (m.plan, m.clarify, m.apply, m.complete) with AI agent-based execution, dry-run validation mode, and step assertion validation

## SCOPE
tests/fixtures/m-plan-test.md
tests/fixtures/m-clarify-test.md
tests/fixtures/m-apply-test.md
tests/fixtures/m-complete-test.md
tests/validation/workflow-validator.md
tests/assertions/step-assertions.md

## PLAN
- [ ] Create test fixture for m.plan workflow with sample intent and expected mission output (dry-run mode)
- [ ] Create test fixture for m.clarify workflow with clarification questions and responses (dry-run mode)
- [ ] Create test fixture for m.apply workflow with active mission and expected execution steps (dry-run mode)
- [ ] Create test fixture for m.complete workflow with completed mission and expected archival (dry-run mode)
- [ ] Create workflow validator with AI agent execution instructions and dry-run validation
- [ ] Create step assertion framework for validating each workflow step without file system changes
- [ ] Note: Allow duplication for initial implementation

## VERIFICATION
find tests/ -name "*.md" | wc -l && grep -r "Step.*:" tests/assertions/
