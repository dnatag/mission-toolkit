# MISSION METRICS

**Mission ID**: 2025-12-21-12-02
**Type**: WET
**Track**: 3
**Status**: completed
**Duration**: ~6 minutes
**Files Modified**: 6

## CHANGE SUMMARY
feat: implement AI prompt unit testing framework with mocked responses

- Created unit test framework with mock layer architecture → enables testing prompt logic without actual AI calls or file system operations
- Built comprehensive M.PLAN and M.CLARIFY unit tests with track calculation validation → tests core prompt processing logic including complexity analysis and reassessment
- Implemented AI response mock library with realistic scenarios → provides predictable responses for various input patterns and complexity levels
- Created filesystem mock layer with operation capture → simulates file system state and captures all I/O operations for validation without side effects

## TECHNICAL DETAILS
- **Scope Adherence**: ✅ Created all 6 files as specified in SCOPE
- **Verification**: ✅ All unit test files created and mock responses configured
- **WET Approach**: ✅ Initial unit testing framework implementation without abstraction
- **Pattern Detection**: No duplication patterns identified

## PROCESS OBSERVATIONS
- Track 3 mission executed successfully with comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Unit testing framework enables validation of prompt logic without AI dependencies
- Mock layer provides controlled environment for testing various scenarios
- Assertion framework ensures thorough validation of prompt processing results
