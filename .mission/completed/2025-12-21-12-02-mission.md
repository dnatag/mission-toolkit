## INTENT
Implement unit testing framework for AI prompts with mocked responses to test prompt logic, track calculation, and mission generation without actual AI calls

## SCOPE
tests/unit/prompt-unit-test.md
tests/unit/m-plan-unit-test.md
tests/unit/m-clarify-unit-test.md
tests/mocks/ai-response-mocks.md
tests/mocks/filesystem-mocks.md
tests/assertions/prompt-assertions.md

## PLAN
- [ ] Create unit test framework for prompt logic with mock layer
- [ ] Implement M.PLAN unit test with mocked AI responses and track calculation validation
- [ ] Implement M.CLARIFY unit test with mocked clarification processing and track reassessment
- [ ] Create AI response mock library with predictable outputs for various inputs
- [ ] Create filesystem mock layer to capture outputs without side effects
- [ ] Build assertion framework for validating prompt logic results
- [ ] Note: Allow duplication for initial implementation

## VERIFICATION
find tests/unit tests/mocks -name "*.md" | wc -l && grep -r "mockAIResponse" tests/unit/
