## INTENT
Update file reading logic in reader.go and reader_test.go to support two timestamp formats for .mission/completed/ files:
- Existing format: {{TIMESTAMP}}-4digits-*.md
- New format: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-SSSS-*.md

## SCOPE
```
internal/mission/reader.go
internal/mission/reader_test.go
```

## PLAN
- [x] Analyze current timestamp parsing logic in reader.go
- [x] Update regex patterns to match both timestamp formats
- [x] Modify file parsing functions to handle dual formats
- [x] Update test cases in reader_test.go to cover both formats

## VERIFICATION
```bash
go test ./internal/mission/ -v
```

## CONSTRAINTS
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing timestamp format
- Ensure all existing tests continue to pass
- New format should follow YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-SSSS pattern exactly

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [x] Both timestamp formats are recognized and parsed correctly
- [x] All existing functionality remains intact
- [x] Test suite passes with 100% coverage for both formats
- [x] No breaking changes to existing mission file reading
