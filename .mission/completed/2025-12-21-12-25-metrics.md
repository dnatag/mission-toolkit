# MISSION METRICS

**Mission ID**: 2025-12-21-12-25
**Type**: WET
**Track**: 3
**Status**: completed
**Duration**: ~5 minutes
**Files Modified**: 4

## CHANGE SUMMARY
refactor: extract prompt logic and expand unit testing framework

- Extracted prompt logic into testable modules with 5 core functions → enables unit testing of individual prompt components without full prompt execution
- Refactored M.PLAN unit test with 4 comprehensive scenarios → tests simple features, security escalation, performance requirements, and complex integrations with proper track calculation
- Created edge case unit tests covering boundary conditions and error scenarios → validates input validation, track complexity limits, multiplier detection edge cases, and mission structure validation
- Built individual function unit tests with comprehensive coverage → provides granular testing of parseUserIntent, calculateTrackComplexity, detectDomainMultipliers, generateMissionStructure, and validateMissionStructure functions

## TECHNICAL DETAILS
- **Scope Adherence**: ✅ Created all 4 files as specified in SCOPE
- **Verification**: ✅ Prompt logic modules exported and unit test files created
- **WET Approach**: ✅ Initial refactored framework implementation without abstraction
- **Pattern Detection**: No duplication patterns identified

## PROCESS OBSERVATIONS
- Track 3 mission executed successfully with comprehensive unit testing refactor
- Extracted prompt logic enables true unit testing of individual functions
- Edge case coverage significantly improves test reliability
- Individual function tests provide granular validation of prompt components
