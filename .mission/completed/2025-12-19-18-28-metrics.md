# MISSION METRICS

## Mission Summary
- **Type**: WET
- **Track**: 2 (Standard)
- **Iteration**: 1
- **Status**: completed
- **Timestamp**: 2025-12-19-18-28
- **Duration**: ~20 minutes

## Intent
Fix high-priority inconsistencies discovered in the consistency analysis report: add ParentMission field to Mission struct, implement parent_mission parsing in reader.go, and standardize track field format in prompt templates to ensure consistency between Go code and prompts.

## Change Summary
fix: resolve mission.md inconsistencies between Go code and prompt templates

- Added ParentMission field to Mission struct in reader.go → enables DRY missions to reference their parent WET missions as specified in prompt templates
- Implemented parent_mission parsing logic in readMissionFile function → ensures Go code can parse the parent_mission field mentioned in DRY mission format
- Standardized track field format in m.plan.md prompt template → removed "| 3" and complexity descriptions to match simple string parsing in Go code
- Enhanced test coverage with parent_mission field validation → ensures new field parsing works correctly and maintains backward compatibility

## Scope Analysis
- **Files Modified**: 3
  - internal/mission/reader.go
  - internal/templates/prompts/m.plan.md
  - internal/mission/reader_test.go
- **New Files Created**: 0
- **Files Deleted**: 0

## Implementation Details
- **Approach**: WET (Write Everything Twice) - Initial implementation allowing duplication
- **Complexity**: Standard track - cross-cutting consistency fixes
- **Domain**: Data structure consistency and parsing
- **Security Impact**: None - structural improvements only

## Verification
- **Command**: `go test ./internal/mission/ -v`
- **Result**: PASSED
- **Test Coverage**: Enhanced with parent_mission field validation

## Patterns Detected
- **Consistency Issues**: Resolved between Go struct and prompt templates
- **Field Validation**: Opportunity identified for future enhancement
- **Template Standardization**: Improved consistency across prompt formats

## Performance Impact
- **Build Time**: No significant impact
- **Runtime**: Minimal - additional field parsing only
- **Memory**: Negligible increase for ParentMission string field

## Learning Outcomes
- Successfully resolved structural inconsistencies between code and templates
- Enhanced system reliability through consistent field handling
- Improved DRY mission capability to reference parent WET missions
- Maintained full backward compatibility during structural changes
