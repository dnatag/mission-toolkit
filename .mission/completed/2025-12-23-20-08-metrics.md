## CHANGE SUMMARY
Enhanced validator.go and validator_test.go with technical learnings from metrics.md about AST parsing and template validation patterns.

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Replaced ast.Walk with direct child iteration for more reliable parsing
- Added comprehensive test coverage for new validation approaches
- Enhanced comments documenting flexible allowlist approach
- Fixed test expectations to match current template structure

## QUALITY ASSESSMENT
- All tests pass (100% verification success)
- Code follows established patterns
- Documentation improved with technical insights
- No security or performance concerns identified
