# MISSION

type: WET
track: 2
iteration: 1
status: completed
completed_at: 2025-12-19T18:03:00.000-05:00

## INTENT
Systematically identify and document inconsistencies between Go code (Mission struct, reader.go parsing) and prompt templates regarding mission.md field handling, parsing, and expected format. Ensure all fields mentioned in prompts are properly handled in Go code and vice versa.

## SCOPE
internal/mission/reader.go
internal/templates/prompts/m.plan.md
internal/templates/prompts/m.apply.md
internal/templates/prompts/m.complete.md
internal/templates/prompts/m.clarify.md

## PLAN
- [ ] Analyze Mission struct fields vs prompt template field references
- [ ] Check if parent_mission field mentioned in DRY missions is handled in Go code
- [ ] Verify all header fields (type, track, iteration, status, completed_at) are consistently used
- [ ] Document any fields that exist in prompts but not in Go parsing logic
- [ ] Document any fields that exist in Go struct but not mentioned in prompts
- [ ] Create comprehensive inconsistency report with recommendations
- [ ] Note: Allow duplication for initial implementation

## VERIFICATION
go test ./internal/mission/ -v && echo "Analysis complete - check output for inconsistencies"
