## INTENT
Remove cline support from the m CLI by removing all references to "cline" from the codebase, including supported AI types list, switch statements, and documentation.

## SCOPE
cmd/init.go
internal/templates/templates.go
internal/templates/templates_test.go
README.md

## PLAN
- [x] Remove "cline" from SupportedAITypes slice in internal/templates/templates.go
- [x] Remove "cline" case from switch statement in internal/templates/templates.go
- [x] Remove "cline" from help text in cmd/init.go
- [x] Remove "cline" from flag description in cmd/init.go
- [x] Remove "cline" test case from internal/templates/templates_test.go
- [x] Update README.md to remove cline from supported AI types list
- [x] Note: Allow duplication for initial implementation

## VERIFICATION
go test ./... && go build -o m .

## OUTCOME
✅ SUCCESS - All cline references removed from codebase

## CHANGE SUMMARY
feat: remove cline support from m CLI

- Removed "cline" from SupportedAITypes slice in templates.go → eliminates cline as a valid AI type option
- Removed cline case from switch statements in templates.go and templates_test.go → prevents cline-specific directory creation logic
- Updated help text and flag descriptions in cmd/init.go → ensures user documentation reflects current supported AI types
- Removed cline test case from templates_test.go → maintains test coverage for only supported AI types
