## INTENT
Add scrollable viewport for large mission details with scroll indicators to improve readability when mission content exceeds screen height.

## SCOPE
/Users/dnatag/git/catalyst-toolkit/internal/tui/status.go

## PLAN
- [x] Add viewport state fields to Model struct (scroll offset, viewport height)
- [x] Implement scroll logic in Update method for Page Up/Down and arrow keys
- [x] Modify renderMissionDetails to handle viewport clipping and scrolling
- [x] Add scroll indicators (e.g., "↑ more above" / "↓ more below") when content overflows
- [x] Update help text to include scroll key bindings
- [x] Note: Allow duplication for initial implementation

## VERIFICATION
go run main.go status

## IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
- Added scrollOffset and viewportHeight fields to Model struct for scroll state management
- Implemented scroll logic with up/down arrows and Page Up/Down keys in detail view
- Modified renderMissionDetails to handle viewport clipping and show visible content only
- Added scroll indicators ("↑ more above" / "↓ more below") when content overflows viewport
- Updated help text to show scroll key bindings (↑/↓: scroll, PgUp/PgDn: fast scroll)
- Fixed scroll bounds bug to prevent over-scrolling past content
- Scroll state resets when entering/exiting detail view for consistent UX
