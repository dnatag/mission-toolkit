## CHANGE SUMMARY
feat: add GitHub Actions CI/CD with cross-platform builds

- Created CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) with automated testing → ensures code quality on every push and PR with Go testing, vetting, and formatting checks
- Created release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) for tagged releases → automates binary building and publishing when version tags are pushed
- Configured GoReleaser (.goreleaser.yml) for cross-platform builds → generates zip archives for Linux, macOS, and Windows (amd64/arm64) with proper versioning
- Set up automated release creation with zip artifacts → provides downloadable binaries for all major platforms with checksums and changelog generation
