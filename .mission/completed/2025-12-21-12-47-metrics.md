# MISSION METRICS

**Mission ID**: 2025-12-21-12-47
**Type**: WET
**Track**: 2
**Status**: completed
**Duration**: ~5 minutes
**Files Modified**: 1

## CHANGE SUMMARY
docs: create AI-native testing framework documentation

- Documented why AI-native testing is needed over code-based approaches → explains language lock-in, execution environment mismatch, and validation paradigm issues with traditional programming frameworks
- Defined what AI-native testing provides through natural language specifications → outlines AI-readable assertions, reasoning-based validation, and execution through AI reasoning rather than code compilation
- Explained how AI-native testing works with complete execution model → details test specification loading, prompt logic simulation, reasoning-based validation, and result documentation processes
- Included comprehensive examples of AI-native test structure → provides complete test case format with scenario, assertions, validation method, and expected reasoning for security feature track escalation

## TECHNICAL DETAILS
- **Scope Adherence**: ✅ Created documentation file as specified in SCOPE
- **Verification**: ✅ Documentation structure and content verified
- **WET Approach**: ✅ Initial documentation implementation without abstraction
- **Pattern Detection**: No duplication patterns identified

## PROCESS OBSERVATIONS
- Track 2 mission executed successfully for single documentation file
- AI-native testing approach clearly differentiated from code-based testing
- Comprehensive examples demonstrate practical application of framework
- Documentation establishes foundation for AI-reasoning-based test validation
