# MISSION METRICS

**Mission ID**: 2025-12-21-13-03
**Type**: DRY
**Track**: 3
**Status**: completed
**Duration**: ~6 minutes
**Files Modified**: 13 (5 created, 8 removed)

## CHANGE SUMMARY
refactor: establish AI-native testing framework and remove programming-based tests

- Removed old programming-based test files and frameworks → eliminates confusion between code-based and AI-native testing approaches
- Created AI-native test specification format with Given/When/Then structure → enables AI agents to validate prompt logic through natural language reasoning
- Built comprehensive mock scenario library using natural language descriptions → provides realistic test data without programming objects or code constructs
- Established reasoning-based assertion patterns and AI execution guide → standardizes validation methodology for AI agents to test prompt logic systematically

## TECHNICAL DETAILS
- **Scope Adherence**: ✅ Removed 8 old files and created 5 new AI-native framework files
- **Verification**: ✅ Framework files created and test cases use proper Given/When/Then format
- **DRY Approach**: ✅ Successfully refactored from programming abstractions to AI-native specifications
- **Pattern Detection**: Eliminated programming language duplication across test framework

## PROCESS OBSERVATIONS
- DRY Track 3 mission executed successfully after previous failed attempt
- AI-native approach correctly avoids programming language abstractions
- Natural language specifications enable AI reasoning-based validation
- Clean directory structure eliminates confusion between testing approaches
