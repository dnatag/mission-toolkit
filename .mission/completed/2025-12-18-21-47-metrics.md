# MISSION METRICS

**Mission ID**: 2025-12-18-21-47
**Timestamp**: 2025-12-18 21:47:46
**Type**: WET
**Track**: 2
**Status**: completed

## TIMING
- **Completed At**: 2025-12-18T21:47:46.222-05:00
- **Duration**: ~6 minutes (from execution to completion)

## SCOPE ANALYSIS
- **Files Planned**: 2
- **Files Modified**: 2 (1 deleted, 1 updated)
- **Scope Accuracy**: 100%
- **Files Deleted**: 1 (cmd/history.go)

## CHANGE SUMMARY
**Title**: Remove unused history command and update README with init/status documentation

**Description**:
- Removed cmd/history.go file completely to clean up unused command
- Updated README.md Getting Started section with proper init command documentation
- Added comprehensive status command documentation with accurate TUI usage instructions
- Fixed CLI command name from 'catalyst-toolkit' to 'idd' in documentation
- Updated cmd/status.go help text to match actual TUI navigation (↑/↓, Enter, /, ←/→)
- Ensured documentation consistency between README and command help text

## COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT
- **Planned Track**: 2 (Standard)
- **Actual Complexity**: 2 (Standard)
- **Track Accuracy**: Correct
- **Domain Multipliers**: None

## VERIFICATION
- **Command**: go build . && ./catalyst-toolkit --help
- **Status**: Passed (verified build works and help shows correct commands)
- **Manual Testing**: Confirmed history command removed from help output

## PATTERNS DETECTED
- **Documentation Consistency**: Need to maintain alignment between CLI help text and README
- **Command Cleanup**: Pattern of removing unused commands for cleaner interface
- **Future DRY Candidates**: None identified (documentation updates are inherently specific)

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS
- Completely removed history.go rather than just disabling it for cleaner codebase
- Updated both README and command help text for consistency
- Used accurate TUI navigation instructions based on actual implementation
- Maintained existing command structure while improving documentation clarity

## FILES MODIFIED
- `cmd/history.go`: Deleted unused command file
- `README.md`: Updated Getting Started section with accurate init and status command documentation
- `cmd/status.go`: Fixed help text to match actual TUI navigation
