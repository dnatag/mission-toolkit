# MISSION METRICS

mission_id: 2025-12-23-13-56
timestamp: 2025-12-23T13:56:30.000Z
type: WET
track: 2
iteration: 1
status: completed

## PERFORMANCE
duration: ~20 minutes
complexity: Track 2 (Standard)
files_modified: 4
lines_changed: ~200

## SCOPE ANALYSIS
planned_files: 2
actual_files: 4 (including go.mod, go.sum)
scope_accuracy: 100%

## VERIFICATION
verification_command: go test ./internal/utils/ -v && go run test program
verification_status: passed
verification_notes: All tests pass, AST-Guided Slicer correctly parses Cards with headers, instructions, and key-value pairs

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Added yuin/goldmark dependency for robust markdown AST parsing
- Created Card struct with Header and Content fields supporting mixed types
- Implemented SliceMarkdown function with direct child iteration for clean parsing
- Added comprehensive test suite covering edge cases and content type validation
- Successfully handles instruction strings in parentheses and key-value list parsing

## PATTERNS DETECTED
- AST walking patterns for markdown parsing
- Mixed content type handling in Go interfaces
- Key-value pair extraction from colon-separated strings

## LESSONS LEARNED
- Direct child iteration more reliable than ast.Walk for this use case
- Text extraction requires recursive walking of text nodes
- Goldmark provides clean AST structure for structured parsing
