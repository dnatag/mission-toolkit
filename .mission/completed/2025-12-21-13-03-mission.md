parent_mission: 2025-12-21-12-25 (prompt logic extraction)

## INTENT
Establish AI-native testing framework for prompt and prompt logic testing using natural language specifications and AI reasoning instead of programming language abstractions

## SCOPE
tests/framework/test-specifications.md
tests/framework/mock-scenarios.md
tests/framework/assertion-patterns.md
tests/framework/execution-guide.md
tests/cases/m-plan-test.md
tests/unit/prompt-logic-modules.md

tests/unit/edge-case-unit-tests.md
tests/unit/prompt-function-unit-tests.md

tests/unit/m-clarify-unit-test.md
tests/unit/m-clarify-unit-test-with-logging.md
tests/unit/m-clarify-track-reassessment-test.md

## PLAN
- [ ] Remove old programming-based test files and frameworks to avoid confusion
- [ ] Create AI-native test specification format in clean framework directory
- [ ] Build mock scenario library using AI-readable descriptions (no programming objects)
- [ ] Define assertion patterns using reasoning-based validation (no code assertions)
- [ ] Create execution guide for AI agents to run tests through reasoning
- [ ] Convert existing M.PLAN test to AI-native format in cases directory
- [ ] Verify framework enables AI-based test execution without programming dependencies

## VERIFICATION
find tests/framework tests/cases -name "*.md" | wc -l && grep -r "Given.*When.*Then" tests/cases/
