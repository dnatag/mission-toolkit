## INTENT
Fix high-priority inconsistencies discovered in the consistency analysis report: add ParentMission field to Mission struct, implement parent_mission parsing in reader.go, and standardize track field format in prompt templates to ensure consistency between Go code and prompts.

## SCOPE
internal/mission/reader.go
internal/templates/prompts/m.plan.md
internal/mission/reader_test.go

## PLAN
- [ ] Add ParentMission string field to Mission struct in reader.go
- [ ] Add parent_mission parsing logic to readMissionFile function
- [ ] Standardize track field format in m.plan.md prompt template (remove "| 3" and complexity descriptions)
- [ ] Add test cases for parent_mission field parsing in reader_test.go
- [ ] Verify all existing tests still pass with new field
- [ ] Note: Allow duplication for initial implementation

## VERIFICATION
go test ./internal/mission/ -v
