## CHANGE SUMMARY
feat: add scrollable viewport for mission details with scroll indicators

- Added scrollOffset and viewportHeight fields to Model struct for scroll state management
- Implemented scroll logic with up/down arrows and Page Up/Down keys in detail view
- Modified renderMissionDetails to handle viewport clipping and show visible content only
- Added scroll indicators ("↑ more above" / "↓ more below") when content overflows viewport
- Updated help text to show scroll key bindings (↑/↓: scroll, PgUp/PgDn: fast scroll)
- Fixed scroll bounds bug to prevent over-scrolling past content
- Scroll state resets when entering/exiting detail view for consistent UX

## QUALITY METRICS
- Proper bounds checking implemented for scroll functionality
- User experience improved with clear scroll indicators
- Help text updated to reflect new capabilities
- Bug discovered and fixed during implementation (scroll bounds)
- Code follows Go conventions and TUI best practices

## LESSONS LEARNED
- Scroll bounds checking is critical for viewport implementations
- User testing reveals edge cases not caught in initial implementation
- TUI scroll indicators significantly improve user experience
- Viewport height calculation needs to account for UI chrome
