## INTENT
Add happy path test cases for m.apply and m.complete commands using the established AI-native testing framework to complete test coverage for all Mission Toolkit commands.

## SCOPE
tests/cases/m-apply-test.md
tests/cases/m-complete-test.md

## PLAN
- [x] Create m-apply-test.md following AI-native test specification format
- [x] Create m-complete-test.md following AI-native test specification format
- [x] Include Given/When/Then structure with natural language assertions
- [x] Use realistic mock scenarios consistent with existing test library
- [x] Note: Allow duplication for initial implementation

## VERIFICATION
find tests/cases -name "m-*-test.md" | wc -l | grep -q "4"
Status: PASSED

## IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
- Created m-apply-test.md with standard mission execution scenarios
- Created m-complete-test.md with mission archival and metrics scenarios
- Followed established AI-native test specification format
- Used Given/When/Then structure with natural language assertions

## PATTERNS IDENTIFIED
- AI-native test case structure is consistent across all commands
- Test scenarios follow realistic mock data patterns
- Validation methods use structured reasoning processes
