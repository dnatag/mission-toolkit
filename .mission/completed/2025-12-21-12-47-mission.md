## SCOPE
docs/ai-native-testing-framework.md

## PLAN
- [ ] Document why AI-native testing is needed (limitations of code-based testing for AI prompts)
- [ ] Define what AI-native testing framework provides (capabilities and benefits)
- [ ] Explain how AI-native testing works (methodology and execution model)
- [ ] Include examples of AI-readable specifications vs code-based tests
- [ ] Note: Allow duplication for initial implementation

## VERIFICATION
grep -A 5 "## Why.*AI-Native" docs/ai-native-testing-framework.md
