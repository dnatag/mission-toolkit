# MISSION METRICS

**Mission ID**: 2025-12-21-11-36
**Type**: WET
**Track**: 2
**Status**: completed
**Duration**: ~3 minutes
**Files Modified**: 1

## CHANGE SUMMARY
test: create clarification workflow test case with track reassessment

- Created comprehensive test fixture demonstrating Track 2→3 reassessment → validates clarification workflow can properly escalate complexity based on revealed requirements
- Defined payment processing scenario with multiple domain multipliers → tests security, performance, and algorithmic complexity triggers for track escalation
- Included detailed track reassessment analysis with domain multiplier breakdown → ensures proper understanding of complexity escalation rules
- Added 7 step assertions for validation → provides comprehensive testing of clarification workflow state transitions and track changes

## TECHNICAL DETAILS
- **Scope Adherence**: ✅ Created test fixture file as specified in SCOPE
- **Verification**: ✅ Track 3 reassessment properly documented and verified
- **WET Approach**: ✅ Initial test case implementation without abstraction
- **Pattern Detection**: No duplication patterns identified

## PROCESS OBSERVATIONS
- Track 2 mission executed successfully for single test fixture creation
- Test case demonstrates complex clarification workflow with multiple domain multipliers
- Comprehensive step assertions ensure thorough validation of track reassessment logic
- Test fixture enables validation of clarification workflow complexity escalation
