## INTENT
Create AI-native test case for M.CLARIFY prompt using established natural language testing framework to validate clarification workflow and track reassessment logic

## SCOPE
tests/cases/m-clarify-test.md

## PLAN
- [ ] Create AI-native test specification for M.CLARIFY using Given/When/Then format
- [ ] Define mock scenario with ambiguous user input requiring clarification
- [ ] Include clarification responses that trigger track reassessment from Track 2 to Track 3
- [ ] Add reasoning-based assertions for clarification processing and track escalation
- [ ] Specify validation method for AI agents to test clarification workflow through reasoning
- [ ] Note: Allow duplication for initial implementation

## VERIFICATION
grep -A 5 "Given.*When.*Then" tests/cases/m-clarify-test.md
