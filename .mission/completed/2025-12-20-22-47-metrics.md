# MISSION METRICS

**Mission ID**: 2025-12-20-22-47
**Type**: WET
**Track**: 3
**Status**: completed
**Duration**: ~3 minutes
**Files Modified**: 6

## CHANGE SUMMARY
feat: create comprehensive test fixtures for prompt workflow validation

- Created 4 test fixtures with dry-run validation mode → enables testing all prompt workflows without file system changes
- Built workflow validator with AI agent execution instructions → provides systematic approach to validate prompt logic and step execution
- Implemented step assertion framework with 25+ assertion types → ensures comprehensive validation of mission structure, transitions, and safety
- Added dry-run mode to all fixtures → prevents side effects during testing while validating complete workflow logic

## TECHNICAL DETAILS
- **Scope Adherence**: ✅ Created all 6 files as specified in SCOPE
- **Verification**: ✅ All test files created and dry-run mode configured
- **WET Approach**: ✅ Initial test framework implementation without abstraction
- **Pattern Detection**: No duplication patterns identified

## PROCESS OBSERVATIONS
- Track 3 mission executed successfully with cross-cutting testing infrastructure
- Dry-run validation mode prevents file system changes during testing
- Comprehensive assertion framework covers all workflow aspects
- Test fixtures enable systematic validation of prompt workflows
