🔄 TRACK ESCALATION: Clarifications revealed Epic complexity

After incorporating your clarifications, this mission has been reassessed as **Track 4 (Epic)** due to its scope and complexity.

## DECOMPOSED SUB-INTENTS

The following atomic sub-intents have been added to `.mission/backlog.md`:

{{BACKLOG_ITEMS}}

## NEXT STEPS

**Epic missions require decomposition before execution:**

1. **Select Priority**: Choose one sub-intent from the backlog to implement first
2. **Plan Sub-Mission**: Use `/m.plan "[selected sub-intent]"` to create an atomic mission
3. **Execute Incrementally**: Complete sub-intents one at a time
4. **Build Progressively**: Each completed sub-intent builds toward the full epic

## RECOMMENDATION

Start with the foundational sub-intent that other components depend on. This ensures a solid base for subsequent implementations.

**Ready to proceed?** Select a sub-intent and run `/m.plan` with your choice.
