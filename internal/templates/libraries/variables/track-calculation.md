TRACK = Calculate based on:
- 0 files = Track 1 (atomic)
- 1-5 files = Track 2 (standard) 
- 6-9 files = Track 3 (robust)
- 10+ files = Track 4 (epic)

Domain Multipliers (+1 track, max Track 3):
- Security keywords: auth, JWT, payment, encryption, security
- Performance keywords: real-time, sub-second, cache, optimize
- High-risk keywords: payment, financial, compliance, regulatory
- Complex keywords: algorithm, ML, AI, crypto, optimization

Final TRACK = min(base_track + multipliers, 3)
